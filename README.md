# ☀️ Photovoltaic Energy Prediction

This project focuses on **predicting photovoltaic (PV) energy generation** using the **HS Ansbach Photovoltaic Dataset**.  
The aim is to build reliable machine learning and deep learning models that forecast solar power generation, supporting renewable energy integration and grid optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and clean PV dataset (handle missing values, timestamps, and outliers)  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand PV generation patterns  
- Train and optimize ML/DL models for energy prediction  
- Evaluate model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score  
- Predict PV output for new or unseen data
