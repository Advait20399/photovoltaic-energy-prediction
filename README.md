## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and clean PV dataset (handle missing values, timestamps, and outliers)  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand PV generation patterns  
- Train and optimize ML/DL models for energy prediction  
- Evaluate model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score  
- Predict PV output for new or unseen data
